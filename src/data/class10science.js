# Chemical Reactions and Equations

**Introduction:**  
Chemical reactions are processes in which substances (reactants) are transformed into new substances (products) with different properties.

## 1. Types of Chemical Reactions
1. **Combination Reaction**: Two or more reactants combine to form a single product.  
   Example: 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O
2. **Decomposition Reaction**: A single compound breaks into two or more products.  
   Example: 2HgO → 2Hg + O₂
3. **Displacement Reaction**: A more reactive element displaces a less reactive element from its compound.  
   Example: Zn + CuSO₄ → ZnSO₄ + Cu
4. **Double Displacement Reaction**: Exchange of ions between two compounds.  
   Example: AgNO₃ + NaCl → AgCl + NaNO₃
5. **Redox Reactions**: Simultaneous oxidation and reduction.  
   Example: Zn + Cu²⁺ → Zn²⁺ + Cu

## 2. Balancing Chemical Equations
- Conservation of mass: Atoms must be same on both sides.
- Steps:
  1. Write unbalanced equation.
  2. Count atoms on both sides.
  3. Adjust coefficients to balance.

**Example:**  
Unbalanced: H₂ + O₂ → H₂O  
Balanced: 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O

## 3. Effects of Chemical Reactions
- Evolution of gas
- Change in color
- Formation of precipitate
- Evolution or absorption of heat

- **Hypermetropia (Far-sightedness):** Can’t see nearby objects. Corrected by convex lens.
- **Presbyopia:** Age-related loss of accommodation.
- **Astigmatism:** Unequal curvature of cornea/lens. Corrected by cylindrical lens.
- **Color blindness:** Inability to distinguish colors.

## 4. Refraction of Light
- Bending of light as it passes from one medium to another.
- **Snell's Law:** \(n_1 \sin i = n_2 \sin r\)
- **Refractive Index:** \(n = \frac{\text{speed of light in vacuum}}{\text{speed in medium}}\)

## 5. Dispersion and Rainbow
- **Dispersion:** Splitting of white light into constituent colors.
- Occurs in prism and raindrops.
- **Rainbow Formation:** Sunlight refracts and reflects inside raindrops; forms a spectrum.

## 6. Scattering of Light
- **Phenomenon:** Redirection of light in many directions by small particles.
- **Reason:** Shorter wavelength (blue) scattered more → sky appears blue.
- **Sunrise/Sunset:** Sun appears red due to scattering of shorter wavelengths.

---

### Examples

**Q1. Why is the sky blue?**  
Blue light scatters more because it has shorter wavelength.

**Q2. How does lens correct myopia?**  
Concave lens diverges light rays so that distant image focuses on retina.

**Q3. Explain rainbow formation.**  
White light enters raindrop → refracts → reflects inside drop → refracts out → forms spectrum.
