# The Rise of Nationalism in Europe

## Introduction
The idea of nationalism in Europe began after the **French Revolution of 1789**. It marked the end of monarchy and the beginning of **liberty, equality, and fraternity**. The revolutionaries introduced new political and social values that inspired people across Europe to fight for freedom and unity.

## The French Revolution and the Idea of the Nation
- The revolution declared France as a nation of citizens, not subjects of a king.
- Symbols like the **tricolour flag**, the **national anthem (La Marseillaise)**, and **La Patrie (the fatherland)** became the essence of unity.
- Internal customs duties were removed, and laws were standardized.
- Weights, measures, and the metric system unified the economy.

## Napoleon Bonaparte’s Role
- Napoleon spread revolutionary principles across Europe through his conquests.
- The **Napoleonic Code (1804)** guaranteed:
  - Equality before law
  - Right to property
  - Abolition of feudal privileges
- However, his wars also led to economic hardship and resentment in conquered areas.

## The Age of Revolutions (1830–1848)
- **Greek War of Independence (1821–29)** inspired nationalism across Europe.
- **1848 Revolution:** Middle class demanded constitutionalism, freedom of press, and equality.
- Women also participated in large numbers, though they were denied political rights.

## Unification of Germany
- Before 1860, Germany consisted of 39 small states.
- **Otto von Bismarck** led the unification through three wars:
  - Denmark (1864)
  - Austria (1866)
  - France (1870–71)
- **Kaiser William I** was proclaimed emperor in 1871.

## Unification of Italy
- Italy was divided into seven states, most under foreign control.
- **Mazzini** (idealist), **Cavour** (politician), and **Garibaldi** (fighter) were key figures.
- In 1861, **Victor Emmanuel II** became king of unified Italy.

## Britain’s Unification
- Achieved through **parliamentary acts** rather than revolution.
- Gradual integration of Scotland, Wales, and Ireland.

## Conclusion
Nationalism in Europe evolved through revolutions, wars, and unification movements. It showed how the idea of a nation could unite people under common ideals of liberty and identity.

# Nationalism in India

## Introduction
After World War I, the struggle for independence in India gained new momentum. **Mahatma Gandhi** led mass movements that united people from all walks of life.

## Early Movements by Gandhiji
1. **Champaran (1917):** Against forced indigo cultivation in Bihar.
2. **Kheda (1918):** Peasants demanded tax remission due to crop failure.
3. **Ahmedabad (1918):** Mill workers protested for better wages.

## The Non-Cooperation Movement (1920–22)
- Launched in protest against the **Rowlatt Act (1919)** and **Jallianwala Bagh Massacre**.
- Indians were urged to:
  - Boycott British schools, law courts, and goods.
  - Resign from government jobs.
- Movement called off after the **Chauri Chaura incident (1922)** due to violence.

## Civil Disobedience Movement (1930)
- Triggered by the **Salt March (Dandi March)** led by Gandhi.
- People broke colonial laws, refused to pay taxes, and boycotted British goods.

## Participation of Social Groups
- **Peasants:** No tax, protested against landlords.
- **Tribals:** Opposed forest laws.
- **Industrial workers:** Struck for better wages and working conditions.
- **Women:** Actively participated in protests.

## Role of the Congress
- Congress under Gandhi made nationalism a **mass movement**.
- Aim: Swaraj (self-rule) through non-violence.

## Conclusion
Indian nationalism grew from scattered protests to a nationwide movement, uniting millions against British colonial rule.

# The Age of Industrialisation

## Introduction
Industrialisation transformed the world from agrarian to industrial societies. It began in Britain in the 18th century and later spread worldwide.

## Before the Industrial Revolution
- Production was small-scale and home-based.
- Merchants provided raw materials to peasants (Proto-industrialisation).
- Labour was manual, with tools like spinning wheels.

## The Industrial Revolution
- **Textile industry** was the first to industrialise.
- Inventions like **Spinning Jenny**, **Steam Engine (James Watt)** revolutionised production.
- Factory system introduced — large-scale, machine-based work.

## Impact on Workers
- Long working hours, low wages, and child labour.
- Formation of early **labour unions** to demand better rights.

## Industrialisation in India
- British policies ruined Indian handloom industry.
- India supplied **raw materials (cotton, jute)** and imported British goods.
- Indian entrepreneurs like **Dwarkanath Tagore**, **Jamsetji Tata** emerged.

## Conclusion
Industrialisation changed society drastically — increasing production but also widening economic inequalities.

2. **Policy Making:** Create manifestos and implement plans.
3. **Law Making:** Members participate in Parliament.
4. **Public Opinion Formation:** Influence through media and campaigns.
5. **Social Welfare:** Mobilize people for reforms.

---

## Types of Party Systems
1. **One-Party System:** Only one party allowed (e.g., China).
2. **Two-Party System:** Two major parties dominate (e.g., USA, UK).
3. **Multi-Party System:** Multiple parties compete (e.g., India).

India has a **multi-party system** encouraging diversity and representation.

---

## National Political Parties
Recognized in **four or more states** by the Election Commission.

### 1. **Indian National Congress (INC):**
   - Oldest party (1885), secular, promotes democracy and economic reform.

### 2. **Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP):**
   - Founded in 1980, promotes nationalism and cultural unity.

### 3. **Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP):**

### 5. **National People’s Party (NPP):**
   - Based in Northeast India; focuses on regional development.

---

## Regional Political Parties
Active in particular states (e.g., DMK, TMC, BJD).  
They address **local issues** and form **coalitions** at the national level.

---

## Challenges to Political Parties
1. **Dynastic Succession:** Power inherited within families.
2. **Corruption:** Use of money and muscle power.
3. **Lack of Internal Democracy:** Few leaders dominate.
4. **Lack of Genuine Choice:** Parties may have similar policies.

# Outcomes of Democracy

## Introduction
Democracy is judged not only by what it promises but also by what it delivers. It should produce a government that is accountable, responsive, and legitimate.

---

## 1. **Accountable, Responsive and Legitimate Government**
- **Accountable:** Elected representatives answerable to people.
- **Responsive:** Acts in public interest.
- **Legitimate:** Formed through free and fair elections.

### Example:
- India conducts elections regularly → legitimacy of government increases.
- People can criticize and replace rulers → accountability ensured.

---

## 2. **Economic Growth and Development**
- Democracies promote equality but not always rapid growth.
- Some authoritarian regimes grow faster (e.g., China).
- Yet, democracy ensures **human development**, not just wealth.

---

## 3. **Reduction of Inequality and Poverty**
- All citizens enjoy equal political rights.
- However, **economic inequality persists** — rich become richer.
- Welfare schemes (MGNREGA, PMAY) aim to reduce poverty.

---

## 4. **Accommodation of Social Diversity**
- Democracy respects differences of religion, region, language.
- Example: India handles diversity better than many nations.
- Success depends on mutual respect and majority rule with minority rights.

---

## 5. **Dignity and Freedom of Citizens**
- Ensures individual dignity.
- Women and minorities have equal rights.
- Freedom of speech, religion, and association protected by law.

---

## Limitations
- Slow decision-making.
- Corruption.
- Sometimes unstable coalitions.

---

## Conclusion
Democracy may not be perfect, but it is the **best form of government** for ensuring equality, justice, and freedom for all.
