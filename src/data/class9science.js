# Chapter 1: Matter in Our Surroundings

**Introduction:**  
Everything in the universe that has mass and occupies space is called matter. From the air we breathe to the chair we sit on, everything is made of matter. Ancient philosophers classified matter into five elements ‚Äî Earth, Water, Air, Fire, and Sky. Modern science studies matter based on its physical and chemical properties.

- **W** ‚Üí Work done  
- **F** ‚Üí Force applied  
- **s** ‚Üí Displacement  
- **Œ∏** ‚Üí Angle between force and displacement

**Unit of Work:** Joule (J)  
1 Joule = When a force of 1 N moves an object by 1 m in the direction of force.

---

## üîπ Positive, Negative, and Zero Work
